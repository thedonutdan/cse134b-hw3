            <h2>Welcome to my Portfolio Site!</h2>
            <p>
                My name is Daniel Andrews. I am a USMC veteran attending the University of California, San Diego. I graduate with a degree in Computer Science in August 2025. 
                I am currently seeking work in Software Engineering or Computer Security. I have developed a great interest in Systems programming/engineering and have worked
                on projects revolving around building operating systems, compilers, distributed storage server clusters and both algorithmic and low-level optimization.
            </p>
            <p>
                I currently live in San Diego, CA and do some freelance work as an AI trainer.
